# Lesson Plan for Instructors
## Fragile Families Challenge class activity
## Prepared by Matt Salganik and Ian Lundberg

This document assumes that you have also read the [lesson plan for participants](https://https://github.com/fragilefamilieschallenge/teaching-support/lesson_plan_masscollaboration_participant.md).

### Instructor preparation

Well in advance of the activity, participants will need to apply for data access. We recommend that you apply for data access even sooner so that you can help participants.

Familiarize yourself with the data files that you receive. They include components to support participants who may be falling behind, including a pre-prepared data file.

### Ethics: Guidelines for instructors

Remind your participants of the importance of using the data ethically. The reason projects like the Fragile Families Challenge are possible is because those who share their data trust that researchers will use it appropriately. As the local organizer, you have some power to set norms about holding the data in a secure location while working with it, not seeking to identify any individuals, and deleting the data when the analysis is complete.  We recommend that you remind participants to delete their data files at the end of the activity.

### Group formation

Form groups of roughly 3 people randomly. You might consider distributing those with the most predictive modeling experience across groups.

### A note about scoring

If you want to score student submissions on the leaderboard set and/or holdout set, you will need to write your own code for scoring. In the original Challenge, we scored participants multiple times on the leaderboard set, and ultimately scored participants one time on the holdout set (1,591 cases). The true leaderboard outcomes are available from the OPR data archive at Fragile Families Challenge / leaderboard.zip, and the true holdout outcomes are available at Fragile Families Challenge / test.zip.

### How to debrief

In the debrief, here are some possible starter questions:

- How did you go about preparing the data file?
- Were there unexpected hurdles when preparing the data file? How did you address them? It is likely that groups took a range of approaches.
- How did you go about the predictive modeling exercise?
- What aspects of the exercise were successful from the standpoint of a participant?
- If you were organizing this mass collaboration, what would you change to make the experience better?
- Are there other questions we might tackle more successfully by working together than by working alone?

### Notes

- This activity is modular so you could just do the afternoon part using the data file that we have already prepared.
